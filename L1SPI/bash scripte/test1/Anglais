There is not one but several forms of obesity.
To assert that the weight is problematic
scientists have defined a specific tool: the body mass index (BMI)

Moderate obesity
to know their BMI is weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared
If the result is between 20 and 25 is considered normal weight. Between 25 and 30 is overweight: The overweight start becoming a threat to health. There is talk of actual obesity when BMI is between 30 and 35. In this case, the disease risks become very important.

Severe Obesity:
 In this case, the risk of developing the disease due to overweight are greatly increased. It is imperative to lose several kilos. And a BMI above 35 surgery may be recommended to treat obesity.

Morbid obesity or massive:
body mass index greater than 40. It is morbid obesity.
massive obesity, with a BMI above 50
 this problem is increasingly worrying in France in 5 years, the number of obese with a BMI over 40 doubled to 0.6% of the population today is concerned.

A distribution problem
experts also distinguish two forms of obesity, depending on the distribution of body fat:

The android obesity
fat mass rather be installed in the upper body. This form would be more hazardous to health, causing more easily problems of hypertension, diabetes or cardiovascular disorders.

The gynoid obesity
fat mass rather be installed in the lower body. This would be fewer repercussions on health, principally causing joint problems
